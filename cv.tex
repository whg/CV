\section{\mysidestyle Employment}

\textbf{Goldsmiths College}, London \vspace{1mm}\\
\textsl{Research Assistant} \hfill 01.2014 - 11.2014 \vspace{2mm} \\
I was awarded a full PhD studentship in Computational Art \& Technology. The first six months were spent
working in a partnership with five London based startups through
\href{http://www.theworkfoundation.com/Aboutus/London-Creative-and-Digital-Fusion}{London
  Fusion}, where I worked on a variety of tools and applications, mostly using Python. Later the
focus of the work moved on to machine learning audio and images in
order to generate media.


\textbf{Polkima}, Izmir \vspace{1mm}\\
\textsl{Computer Programmer} \hfill 10.2013 - 01.2014 \vspace{2mm} \\
I resolved various computing problems for Polkima, a glass reinforced plastics producer in Turkey. This involved programming a Comau industrial robot in the PDL2
domain specific language to trim tractor engine bonnets. I also wrote multiple tools in Excel VBA to automate invoice generation, product
verification and other accounting tasks.


\textbf{Matt Watkins Design}, London \vspace{1mm}\\
\textsl{iOS Programmer} \hfill 05.2012 - 10.2012 \vspace{2mm} \\
I was the sole developer for
\href{http://wurfelmosaik.com/}{W\"{u}rfel-Mosaik}, a digital version
of the classic Swiss children`s game of the same name. The iPhone/iPad
application makes considerable use of iCloud, Core Graphics and social
networking APIs.

\textbf{Hellicar \& Lewis}, London \vspace{1mm}\\
\textsl{Interaction Designer} \hfill 06.2012 - 08.2012 \vspace{2mm} \\
I worked in a team of three developers creating
\href{http://www.hellicarandlewis.com/intel/}{Triptych},
a set of interactive installations showcasing Intel's new range of
processors. Interaction was through a Microsoft Kinect sensor and
large projections. The projects were programmed in C++ \& GLSL and
used openFrameworks. The project was
\href{https://github.com/HellicarAndLewis/Triptych}{open source}.

\textbf{greyworld}, London  \vspace{1mm}\\
\textsl{Computer Programmer} \hfill 07.2010 - 09.2010 \vspace{2mm} \\
I worked on real-time generative visuals for London
based art collective \href{http://greyworld.org}{greyworld} and
advertising agency Ogilvy. The project was built with Processing.

\section{\mysidestyle Skills}

\textbf{Audio Visual Computer Programming} \vspace{1mm} \\
I have programming experience in a number of environments and I am
familiar with a wide range of tools. For realtime projects I primarily work in
\textbf{C++}, using OpenGL (\textbf{GLSL}) and possibly utilising
libraries such as \textbf{openFrameworks} or \textbf{Cinder}. For mobile applications I like to use iOS with \textbf{Objective-C}.  I have considerable experience working with audio at the buffer.

\textbf{Web based Programming} \vspace{1mm} \\
I have worked in the back and front end of the web domain. I recently won the Spotify prize for a \textbf{Javascript} based music mixing application at the London Music Hackday. I have also built database driven serverside applications with \textbf{Python} using django and also with \textbf{PHP}. I have experience with a range of databases, from \textbf{MySQL}/\textbf{Postgres} to \textbf{MongoDB}.

\textbf{Machine Learning} \vspace{1mm} \\
I have experience in implementing machine learning and signal processing algorithms in \textbf{GNU Octave}/\textbf{MATLAB} and \textbf{Python}. At a postgraduate level, I have researched various modern techniques for learning and prediction.

\textbf{Embedded Programming and Electronics} \vspace{1mm} \\
I have an interest in embedded programming where I usually write firmware in \textbf{C}. I
frequently use the \textbf{Arduino} to prototype, though I have also built projects from the ground up.

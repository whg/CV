\section{\mysidestyle Skills}

\textbf{Computer Programming} \vspace{1mm} \\
I have experience programming in a number of languages and environments. At University I program in Java, C, C++ and GNU Octave for projects ranging from multi-threaded servers to computer vision to digital signal processing. Outside of University, I work on websites and other projects using languages such as Python, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.

I have great experience working with graphical languages such as Processing, and libraries such as openFrameworks as well as OpenGL and GLSL.

\textbf{System Admistration} \vspace{1mm} \\
I run a Linux webserver and host websites for myself and friends, through this I am very comfortable in the UNIX shell and emacs editor.

\textbf{Graphic Design} \vspace{1mm} \\
I have many years of experience with Adobe tools such as Photoshop and Illustrator. I can also comfortable in 3D environments such as Blender.

\section{\mysidestyle Recent Work}

\textbf{Visualising the London Underground} \vspace{1mm} \\
For a project in a graphics course at Univeristy, I visualised real Underground journeys published by Transport for London. I programmed this in OpenGL, where every journey was stored as a pixel in a buffer object and transformations were applied by the GPU using GLSL.

\textbf{Fabricate} \vspace{1mm} \\
\href{https://github.com/whg/fabricate}{Fabricate}, which is running my personal website, creates dynamic websites from text files, where 100\% of the content is generated on the client side. Features include navigation via a command line and automatic pushing of content. It was made using JavaScript, Python and shell scripts.

\textbf{Pedro \& Sybil} \vspace{1mm} \\
For a second year project at University, I built and programmed a plotter (Pedro) and also wrote an accompanying piece of software to control it (Sybil). Full details, images, videos and code can be seen at: \href{http://pedroandsybil.com}{pedroandsybil.com}. The plotter is controlled via a USB port on a laptop, where users can preview and manipulate the text/images before they are drawn.  The software is native Mac OS X application programmed in C++/Objective-C using Cocoa and openFrameworks. The plotter’s firmware is programmed directly in C. All source code is open.

I recently won the first prize in the Goldsmiths Computing department art competition, my entry can be seen at \href{http://wgallia.com#!adventuresinsine}{wgallia.com\#!adventuresinsine}.
